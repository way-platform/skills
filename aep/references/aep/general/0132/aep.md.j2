# List

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `GET` request to a resource
collection's URI (for example, `/publishers/{publisher_id}/books`) in order to
retrieve a list of the resources within that collection.

Resource-oriented design AEP-121 honors this pattern through the `List` method.
These RPCs accept a parent collection (if one exists), and return a list of
responses matching that input.

## Guidance

APIs **should** provide a `List` method for resource collections.The purpose of
the `List` method is to return data from a finite collection (generally
singular unless the operation supports [reading across collections][]).

When the `GET` method is used on a URI ending in a resource collection, the
result **must** be a list of resources.

### Operation

{% tab proto %}

{% sample '../example.proto', 'rpc ListBooks' %}

- The RPC's name **must** begin with the word `List`. The remainder of the RPC
  name **should** be the plural form of the resource's message name.
- The request message **must** match the RPC name, with a `-Request` suffix.
- The response message **must** match the RPC name, with a `-Response` suffix.
  - The response **should** include fully-populated resources unless there is a
    reason to return a partial response (see AEP-157).
- The HTTP verb **must** be `GET`.
- If the collection has a parent resource, The URI **must** contain a field
  corresponding to the collection parent's name.
  - This field **must** be called `parent`.
  - The URI **must** have a variable corresponding to this field.
  - The `parent` field **must** be the only variable in the URI path. All
    remaining parameters **must** map to URI query parameters.
- There **must not** be a `body` key in the `google.api.http` annotation.
- There **should** be exactly one `google.api.method_signature` annotation with
  a value of `"parent"` if a parent exists, and an empty string otherwise.

{% tab oas %}

```http
GET /v1/publishers/{publisher_id}/books HTTP/2
Host: bookstore.example.com
Accept: application/json
```

`List` operations **must** be made by sending a `GET` request to the resource
collection's URI:

- The HTTP method **must** be `GET`.
  - The request **must** be safe and **must not** have side effects.
- There **must not** be a request body.
  - If a `GET` request contains a body, the body **must** be ignored, and
    **must not** cause an error.
- The request **must not** require any fields in the query string.
  - The query string **may** include fields for common design patterns relevant
    to list methods, such as `string filter` and `string orderBy`.
- The URI **should** contain a variable for each individual ID in the resource
  hierarchy.
  - The path parameter for all resource IDs **must** be in the form
    `{resourceName}_id` (such as `book_id`), and path parameters representing
    the ID of parent resources **must** end with `Id`.

{% endtabs %}

### Requests

{% tab proto %}

{% sample '../example.proto', 'message ListBooksRequest' %}

- A `parent` field **must** be included unless the resource being listed is a
  top-level resource. It **should** be called `parent`.
  - The field **must** be [annotated as required][aep-203].
  - The field **must** identify the [resource type][] of the resource being
    listed with a `aepi.api.field_info.resource_reference` annotation.
  - The field **must** accept the parent [path, _not_ the id](./0122)
- The `max_page_size` and `page_token` fields, which support pagination,
  **must** be specified on all list request messages. For more information, see
  AEP-158.

**Note:** The `parent` field in the request object corresponds to the `parent`
variable in the `google.api.http` annotation on the RPC. This causes the
`parent` field in the request to be populated based on the value in the URL
when the REST/JSON interface is used.

{% tab oas %}

{% sample '../example.oas.yaml', '$.paths./publishers/{publisher_id}/books.get.parameters' %}

{% endtabs %}

### Responses

`List` operations **must** return a page of results, with each individual
result being a resource.

- The array of resources **must** be named `results` and contain resources with
  no additional wrapping.
- The `string nextPageToken` field **must** be included in the list response
  schema. It **must** be set if there are subsequent pages, and **must not** be
  set if the response represents the final page. For more information, see
  AEP-158.
- The response struct **may** include a `int32 total_size` (or
  `int64 total_size`) field with the number of items in the collection.
  - The value **may** be an estimate (the field **should** clearly document
    this if so).
  - If filtering is used, the `total_size` field **should** reflect the size of
    the collection _after_ the filter is applied.
- The response message **must** include a field corresponding to the resources
  being returned, named for the English plural term for the resource, and
  **should not** include any other repeated fields.
- Fields providing metadata about the list request (such as
  `string next_page_token` or `int32 total_size`) **must** be included on the
  response (not as part of the resource itself).

{% tab proto %}

{% sample '../example.proto', 'message ListBooksResponse' %}

{% tab oas %}

{% sample '../example.oas.yaml', '$.paths./publishers/{publisher_id}/books.get.responses.200' %}

- The field "results" **must** be an array of resources, with the schema as a
  reference to the resource (e.g. `#/components/schemas/Book`).
- The field "nextPageToken" **must** be a string that contains the token to
  retrieve the next page. This **must not** be set if the response represents
  the final page.

{% endtabs %}

**Note:** List methods **may** return the complete collection to any user with
permission to make a successful List request on the collection, _or_ **may**
return a collection only containing resources for which the user has read
permission. This behavior **should** be clearly documented either for each List
method or as a standard convention in service-level documentation. Permission
checks on individual resources may have a negative performance impact so should
be used only where absolutely necessary.

### Errors

If the user does not have sufficient permission to know that the collection
exists, the service **should** reply with an HTTP 404 error, regardless of
whether or not the collection exists. Permission **must** be checked prior to
checking whether the collection exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested collection does not
exist (generally because the parent does not exist), the service **must** reply
with an HTTP 404 error.

**Note:** An empty collection which the user has permission to access **must**
return `200 OK` with an empty results array, and not `404 Not Found`.

### Advanced operations

`List` methods **may** allow an extended set of functionality to allow a user
to specify the resources that are returned in a response.

The following table summarizes the applicable AEPs, ordered by the precedence
of the operation on the results.

| Operation                      | AEP                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| filter                         | [AEP-160](/0160)                   |
| ordering (`order_by`)          | [AEP-132](#ordering)               |
| pagination (`next_page_token`) | [AEP-158](/0158)                   |
| skip                           | [AEP-158](/0158/#skipping-results) |

For example, if both the `filter` and `skip` fields are specified, then the
filter would be applied first, then the resulting set would be the results that
skip N entries of the filtered result.

### Ordering

`List` methods **may** allow clients to specify sorting order; if they do, the
request message **should** contain a `string order_by` field.

- Values **should** be a comma separated list of fields. For example:
  `"foo,bar"`.
- The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a
  field, users append a `-` prefix; for example: `"foo,-bar"`, `"-foo,bar"`.
- Redundant space characters in the syntax are insignificant. `"foo, -bar"`,
  `" foo , -bar "`, and `"foo,-bar"` are all equivalent.
- Subfields are specified with a `.` character, such as `foo.bar` or
  `address.street`.

**Note:** Only include ordering if there is an established need to do so. It is
always possible to add ordering later, but removing it is a breaking change.

### Soft-deleted resources

Some APIs need to "[soft-delete][]" resources, marking them as deleted or
pending deletion (and optionally purging them later).

APIs that do this **should not** include deleted resources by default in list
requests. APIs with soft deletion of a resource **should** include a
`bool show_deleted` field in the list request that, if set, will cause
soft-deleted resources to be included.
