# Best practices for testing

This document provides guidelines and recommendations for testing Terraform for Google Cloud modules and configurations.

Testing Terraform modules and configurations sometimes follows different patterns and conventions from testing application code. While testing application code primarily involves testing the business logic of applications themselves, fully testing infrastructure code requires deploying real cloud resources to minimize the risk of production failures. There are a few considerations when running Terraform tests:

- Running a Terraform test creates, modifies, and destroys real infrastructure, so your tests can potentially be time-consuming and expensive.
- _You cannot purely unit test an end-to-end architecture_. The best approach is to break up your architecture into modules and test those individually. The benefits of this approach include faster iterative development due to faster test runtime, reduced costs for each test, and reduced chances of test failures from factors beyond your control.
- _Avoid reusing state if possible_. There may be situations where you are testing with configurations that share data with other configurations, but ideally each test should be independent and should not reuse state across tests.

## Use less expensive test methods first

There are multiple methods that you can use to test Terraform. In ascending order of cost, run time, and depth, they include the following:

- **Static analysis:** Testing the syntax and structure of your configuration without deploying any resources, using tools such as compilers, linters, and dry runs. To do so, use [`terraform validate`](https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/validate)
- **Module integration testing**: To ensure that modules work correctly, test individual modules in isolation. Integration testing for modules involves deploying the module into a test environment and verifying that expected resources are created. There are several testing frameworks that make it easier to write tests, as follows:
    - [Google's blueprint testing framework](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit/infra/blueprint-test)
    - [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/)
    - [Kitchen-Terraform](https://newcontext-oss.github.io/kitchen-terraform/)
    - [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-gcp)
    - [tftest](https://pypi.org/project/tftest/)
- **End-to-end testing:** By extending the integration testing approach to an entire environment, you can confirm that multiple modules work together. In this approach, deploy all modules that make up the architecture in a fresh test environment. Ideally, the test environment is as similar as possible to your production environment. This is costly but provides the greatest confidence that changes don't break your production environment.

## Start small

Make sure that your tests iteratively build on each other. Consider running smaller tests first and then working up to more complex tests, using a _fail fast_ approach.

## Randomize project IDs and resource names

To avoid naming conflicts, make sure that your configurations have a globally unique project ID and non-overlapping resource names within each project. To do this, use namespaces for your resources. Terraform has a built-in [random provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs) for this.

## Use a separate environment for testing

During testing, many resources are created and deleted. Ensure that the environment is isolated from development or production projects to avoid accidental deletions during resource cleanup. The best approach is to have each test create a fresh project or folder. To avoid misconfiguration, consider creating service accounts specifically for each test execution.

## Clean up all resources

Testing infrastructure code means that you are deploying actual resources. To avoid incurring charges, consider implementing a clean-up step.

To destroy all remote objects managed by a particular configuration, use the `terraform destroy` command. Some testing frameworks have a built-in cleanup step for you. For example, if you are using Terratest, add `defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)` to your test. If you're using Kitchen-Terraform, delete your workspace using `terraform kitchen delete WORKSPACE_NAME`.

After you run the `terraform destroy` command, also run additional clean-up procedures to remove any resources that Terraform failed to destroy. Do this by deleting any projects used for test execution or by using a tool like the [`project_cleanup`](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-scheduled-function/tree/master/modules/project_cleanup) module.

**Warning:** Don't use such tools in a production environment.

## Optimize test runtime

To optimize your test execution time, use the following approaches:

- **Run tests in parallel.** Some testing frameworks support running multiple Terraform tests simultaneously.
    - For example, with Terratest you can do this by adding `t.Parallel()` after the test function definition.
- **Test in stages.** Separate your tests into independent configurations that can be tested separately. This approach removes the need to go through all stages when running a test, and accelerates the iterative development cycle.
    - For example, in Kitchen-Terraform, split tests into separate suites. When iterating, execute each suite independently.
    - Similarly, using Terratest, wrap each stage of your test with `stage(t, STAGE_NAME, CORRESPONDING_TEST_FUNCTION)`. Set environment variables that indicate which tests to run. For example, `SKIP_STAGE_NAME="true"`.
    - The [blueprint testing framework](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit/infra/blueprint-test) supports staged execution.
