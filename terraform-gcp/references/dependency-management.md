# Best practices on dependency management

This document provides recommendations for expressing dependencies between resources in your Terraform configuration.

## Favor implicit dependencies over explicit dependencies

Resource dependencies arise when one resource depends on the existence of other resources. Terraform must be able to understand these dependencies to ensure that resources are created in the correct order. For example, if resource A has a dependency on resource B, resource B is created before resource A.

Terraform configuration dependencies can be established through [implicit and explicit dependency declarations](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/dependencies). Implicit dependencies are declared through [expression references](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/references), while explicit dependencies are specified by using the [`depends_on`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on) meta argument. The `depends_on` argument specifies that Terraform must complete all the actions on the object(s) that a resource or a module depends on, before proceeding with the dependent object.

While both approaches ensure a correct order of operations, implicit dependencies often lead to more efficiency in planning for [updates and replacement of resources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on#processing-and-planning-consequences). This is because Terraform can intelligently track the specific fields involved in an implicit dependency, potentially avoiding changes to the dependent resource if those specific fields remain unaltered within the dependency.

In comparison to implicit dependencies, explicit dependencies convey less specific information. This means that Terraform can only formulate more conservative plans for resource creation, updates, and replacement in the absence of knowledge of the particular attributes that constitute the dependency. In practice, this impacts the sequence in which resources are created by Terraform and how Terraform determines whether resources require updates or replacements.

We recommended using explicit dependencies with the `depends_on` meta argument only as the last resort when a dependency between two resources is hidden and can't be expressed through implicit dependencies.

In the following example, the required project services must be enabled before creating a BigQuery dataset. This dependency is declared explicitly:

Not recommended:

```hcl
module "project_services" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/project-factory/google//modules/project_services"
  version = "~> 14.4"

  project_id = var.project_id
  activate_apis = [
    "bigquery.googleapis.com",
    "bigquerystorage.googleapis.com",
  ]
}

module "bigquery" {
  source       = "terraform-google-modules/bigquery/google"
  version      = "~> 5.4"

  dataset_id   = "demo_dataset"
  dataset_name = "demo_dataset"
  project_id   = var.project_id
  depends_on = [module.project_services] # <- explicit dependency
}
```

The following example replaces the explicit dependency with an implicit dependency by referencing the `project_id` argument as the `project_id` output attribute of the `project_services` resource:

Recommended:

```hcl
module "bigquery" {
  source       = "terraform-google-modules/bigquery/google"
  version      = "~> 5.4"

  dataset_id   = "demo_dataset"
  dataset_name = "demo_dataset"
  project_id   = module.project_services.project_id # <- implicit dependency
}
```

The use of implicit dependencies allows for precise declarations of dependencies, such as specifying the exact information that needs to be collected from an upstream object. This also reduces the need for making changes in multiple places, which in turn reduces the risk of errors.

## Reference output attributes from dependent resources

When you create implicit dependencies by referencing values from upstream resources, make sure to only reference output attributes, specifically [values that are not yet known](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/references#values-not-yet-known). This will ensure that Terraform waits for the upstream resources to be created before provisioning the current resource.

In the following example, the `google_storage_bucket_object` resource references the name argument of the `google_storage_bucket` resource. Arguments have known values during the Terraform plan phase. This means that when Terraform creates the `google_storage_bucket_object` resource, it doesn't wait for the `google_storage_bucket` resource to be created because referencing a known argument (the bucket name) doesn't create an implicit dependency between the `google_storage_bucket_object` and the `google_storage_bucket`. This defeats the purpose of the implicit dependency declaration between the two resources.

Not recommended:

```hcl
# Cloud Storage bucket
resource "google_storage_bucket" "bucket" {
  name = "demo-bucket"
  location = "US"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "bucket_object" {
  name   = "demo-object"
  source = "./test.txt"
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.bucket.name # name is an input argument
}
```

Instead, `google_storage_bucket_object` resource must reference the `id` output attribute of the `google_storage_bucket_object` resource. Since the `id` field is an output attribute, its value is only set after the creation of its resource has been executed. Therefore, Terraform will wait for the creation of the `google_storage_bucket_object` resource to complete before beginning the creation of the `google_storage_bucket_object` resource.

Recommended:

```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "bucket_object" {
  name   = "demo-object"
  source = "./test.txt"
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.bucket.id # id is an output attribute
}
```

Sometimes there is no obvious output attribute to reference. For example, consider the following example where `module_a` takes the name of the generated file as input. Inside `module_a`, the filename is used to read the file. If you run this code as-is, you'll get a `no such file or directory` exception, which is caused by Terraform attempting to read the file during its planning phase, at which time the file hasn't been created yet. In this case, an examination of the output attribute of the `local_file` resource reveals that there are no obvious fields that you can use in place of the filename input argument.

Not recommended:

```hcl
resource "local_file" "generated_file" {
 filename = "./generated_file.text"
 content = templatefile("./template.tftpl", {
   project_id = var.project_id
 })
}

module "module_a" {
 source = "./modules/module-a"
 root_config_file_path = local_file.generated_file.filename
}
```

You can solve this problem by introducing an explicit dependency. As a best practice, make sure add a comment on why the explicit dependency is needed:

Recommended:

```hcl
module "module_a" {
 source = "./modules/module-a"
 root_config_file_path = local_file.generated_file.filename
 depends_on = [local_file.generated_file] # waiting for generated_file to be created
}
```

# Best practices for cross-configuration communication

This page provides guidelines and recommendations for cross-configuration communication when using Terraform for Google Cloud.

This guide is not an introduction to Terraform. For an introduction to using Terraform with Google Cloud, see [Get started with Terraform](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/get-started-with-terraform).

A common problem that arises when using Terraform is how to share information across different Terraform configurations (possibly maintained by different teams). Generally, information can be shared between configurations without requiring that they be stored in a single configuration directory (or even a single repository).

The recommended way to share information between different Terraform configurations is by using remote state to reference other root modules. [Cloud Storage](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/gcs.html) or [Terraform Enterprise](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/terraform-enterprise.html) are the preferred state backends.

For querying resources that are not managed by Terraform, use data sources from the [Google provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs). For example, the default Compute Engine service account can be retrieved [using a data source](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/data-sources/compute_default_service_account). Don't use data sources to query resources that are managed by another Terraform configuration. Doing so can create implicit dependencies on resource names and structures that normal Terraform operations might unintentionally break.
